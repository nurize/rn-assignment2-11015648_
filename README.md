DCIT 202 - MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT
STUDENT ID- 11015648

#TASK DESCRIPTION
This assignment was to teach us how to create a react-native app using the Expo CLI.
It exposes students to the world of problem-solving as it requires you to resolve all errors displayed in the terminal during the app-creation process. 
It also tests our understanding of React and JSX, as well as our GitHub knowledge.
